# Gousto Recipe Card Generator

This project is a simple static React application that allows users to generate PDF recipe cards from Gousto recipes, directly in the browser. Users can input a Gousto recipe URL, and the application will fetch the recipe details, including ingredients and cooking instructions, and generate a PDF with the recipe card. Note that the layout of this recipe card is A4 and is optimised for printing.

## Features

- Fetch recipe details including images, ingredients and cooking instructions from a Gousto recipe URL
- Prepare a single pagerecipe card PDF with the recipe details, optimised for printing
- Responsive design for a better user experience on different devices
